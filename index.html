            When my friend contacted me about doing an internship/software
            contracting job, I was extremely excited. I wanted to experience how
            it would be like to interact professionally with other people to get
            a serious task done by a deadline. IVAN (Intelligent Virtual
            Assisting Navigator) was an application I developed which could
            navigate through websites given a desired command from the user to
            pull useful information. Although it seems similar to web scraping,
            the system uses three Deep Learning models to interact with websites
            like a human. I earned $1.0k from this project but most importantly,
            I learned a lot and deep-dived into my journey as a data scientist.

            My friends have been a huge influence on me in an entrepreneurial
            sense. I was inspired by them when they kept talking about creating
            their own companies and becoming entrepreneurs. I realized that
            security cameras in this era are either extremely expensive or not
            scalable. What if there was a product on the market that was
            cost-efficient, had AI incorporated in the system, and targeted
            public security? Thus, the idea of DeepNet began to grow. As of now,
            I am developing a prototype for the idea and I am also contacting
            investors as well so that I can make this soon to be company grow.
            By creating a product which most of the population can afford as
            well as targeting a whole new portion of the market, DeepNet has a
            lot of potential and is allowing me to gain a lot of
            technical/business experience as well.

            This app was created when I realized that the process of signing up
            and creating clubs at Dublin High was extremely tedious and
            difficult for both the students and the staff. I started thinking of
            different ways I could help the school out and make clubs more
            accessible to students as well. That’s when I decided to create Club
            Central. After a couple days of brainstorming and polishing the
            idea, I decided to create an app using React Native and a firebase
            pipeline which could show all the clubs at Dublin High through the
            touch of your fingertips. This app has changed the entire club
            creation and sign-up process at Dublin High. With an expected user
            base of over 3000+ downloads, Club Central is one of my most popular
            ideas and revolutionized the way clubs work at my school.

            Slider was the first mobile app I created which is currently
            available on the App and Play Store. When I began app development, I
            realized that the best way to learn was to start a project in which
            I could show other people who could give me feedback. I came up with
            a simple idea which I thought could be a fun first project for me to
            begin my app development career. A sliding puzzle game where users
            can select pictures from their gallery or take pictures using their
            camera allowed my users to enjoy a fun game whenever they wanted.
            With over 250+ downloads Slider was a fun and successful first
            project.

            A lot of my friends were seniors before this idea came into my head.
            Seeing them struggle with paying for their undergrad and getting
            into the schools they wanted to showed me that the education system
            had to change. I got some inspiration from Uber and came up with an
            idea that I think will revolutionize the way education is received.
            Disciplina is a concept I came up with where users can find
            specialized “workshops” near them using an Uber-like google maps
            interface. The face-to-face interaction as well as the video/text
            interface feature makes this app much better than current
            competitors. Students can receive a cost-efficient personal
            education from qualified mentors looking to make quick side-hustle
            money.

            I created this mobile application for 2018-2019 VRC Turning Point
            and 2019-2020 VRC Tower Takeover. This application contains multiple
            features that teams can use to scout different alliance partners.
            Some features this application has include a match predictor based
            on a FFNN trained from over 3000 past matches, a statistics
            displayer, a team information displayer, and a notes page. My team
            and I believed that by creating this application, we would be able
            to utilize its features to effectively scout alliance partners. This
            app is currently available on the App and Play store. The app
            currently has over 200+ downloads.

            Programming is a tedious part of being on a VRC competition team
            because of how much you have to fine-tune the motor values. To help
            my team, I started to think of different ways we could quickly
            output autonomous code if we have a plan in our head. That’s when it
            hit me! What if you could output code by interacting with a program
            like a game? The Unity 5327 simulation which could effectively
            output code was born. The user starts the simulation and uses the
            arrow keys to move the robot around. After 15 seconds, the
            simulation outputs a c++ file which can be directly uploaded to a
            real robot. I also added an Artificially Intelligent A*
            search based agent that the user could play against. The judges at
            worlds said they had never seen anything like it before and it
            helped us win Create Award.
